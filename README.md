# Probability_Theory
A Quick Introduction to Probability Theory. This tutorial aims to refresh all most important concepts in probability theory with simple examples. Probability theory is the key foundation of statistics, econometrics and data science. Make you understand all the details in the example, use these examples as your references when encounter new problems.

## Prerequiste
Since this is not an academic course, there is no sophisticated derivation, only practical examples, you need don't any prerequiste except freshman level mathematics.
